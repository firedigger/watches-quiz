    <h1>Rules:</h1>
    <p>You will see a picture of the watches.</p>
    <p>Your aim is to guess the price of the watches.</p>
    <p>The main score metric is the digits difference between the actual price and your guess.</p>
    <p>For example, if the actual price is 5000 and you guess 2000, the difference is 0 (correct guess), and if you guess 900, the
        difference is 1.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the absolute difference in euros will be shown but won't affect the rank.</p>
    <p>There are {{ watchesCount }} watches in total, from €{{ minPrice }} to €{{maxPrice }}</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
    <p>The game creator does not hold responsibility for the factual correctness of the price estimations beyond the offers found on the internet at the time of the development.</p>
